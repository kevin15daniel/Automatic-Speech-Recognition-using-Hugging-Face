# Automatic-Speech-Recognition-using-Hugging-Face
A 'Automatic Speech Recognition using Hugging Face' is a project where I developed and implemented an efficient speech recognition model utilizing Hugging Face technology. By employing state-of-the-art techniques, I enhanced accuracy and performance in transcribing spoken language to text.

More Info:

• How does it work? It utilizes the Hugging Face library to preprocess and fine-tune pre-trained models, such as Wav2Vec2, for speech recognition tasks.

• Resources: (1.) Python programming language; (2.) Hugging Face library; (3.) Speech recordings for training and testing; (4.) Data manipulation libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy); and (5.) Version control systems (e.g., Git).

• Showcased at (off-site): NIL
